### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Software Engineer at Hydraloop Systems

Currently at Hydraloop, Iâ€™m working on expanding the Hydraloop Device Manager, an IoT platform that connects all Hydraloop devices.

Here are the projects Iâ€™m currently focused on:

- Leading the development of a new mobile app platform for Hydraloop customers. This involves designing and building an app where users can check data from their Hydraloop device and customize their experience to save more water. ðŸ’§
- Creating â€˜Maintenance Actionsâ€™, a system that guides partners and technicians through step-by-step maintenance for Hydraloop devices.
