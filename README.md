### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Software Engineer at Hydraloop Systems

On this account I mostly do professional work.

At Hydraloop I am working on the expansion of the Hydraloop Device Manager. An IoT platform to which all Hydraloop devices are connected. 


Projects I'm currently working on:

In the lead of creating a new mobile app platform for customers @ Hydraloop
This project features the design and development of an application where users can read data from their Hydraloop device and customize their experience to help save more of one of the most precious resources: water. ðŸ’§

Also working on Maintenance Actions, a system where partners and technicians can use step-by-step guidance on Hydraloop device maintenance.
